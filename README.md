# English Premier League Predictions
Predicting weekly football results in EPL for the 2017 season. 
Updated every week.

#### Structure
- Data : folder with all the relevant data used in the analysis
- EDA_Prediction : contains a detail exploration of the dataset and tries to answer a specific question. Can we use data to explicitly show that teams actually possess a 'home advantage'? We then go on to see how home advantage is gradually decreasing in the EPL - a hunch that I wished to find out.
- EPL_Prediction : weekly predictions of the English Premier League's matches
- EPL_Prediction_Tuning : trying out different approaches in predictions. Under progress.
- Report : a comprehensive report of the whole process
